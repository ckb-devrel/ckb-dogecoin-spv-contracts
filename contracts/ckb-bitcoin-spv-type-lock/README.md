# CKB Dogecoin SPV Type Script

A type script designed for Dogecoin SPV clients ensures the valid synchronization of the [Dogecoin] blockchain state into the Nervos [CKB] network.

This project is a fork of the CKB [Bitcoin] SPV Type Script, modified to support Dogecoin. It implements a similar mechanism for syncing Dogecoin blockchain state into CKB.
